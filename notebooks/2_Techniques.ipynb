This disregards the information from the rest of the dataset (classes) and just because A and B are distinguishable from each other in isolation, they may not be when other classes are present since they may be overlapped with those.  Still, it can be helpful to see how different classes really are in terms of their feature distributions.  Below, at left, is the binary JSD for the classes we just looked at.  Clearly B and C are essentially identical, and D is not easily distinguished from any of them.  It can sometimes be helpful to perform feature engineering to amplify hidden correlations that can create differences.  Below, at right, polynomial features to [order 3](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) were created and re-evaluated; this creates products of columns which can be helpful if correlations exist.

In practice, the distributions for a given feature are histogrammed into discrete bins, from which the KLD and JSD can be easily computed.  As a side note, in practice some small amount added to all bins (~1.0e-12) since numerically, we cannot divide by zero in the KLD calculation.  This is a small affect usually, should be noted."

For example, selecting $n_{\\rm bins}=1$ means a single bin, which clearly will then encompass everything leading to JSD = 0 between any two distributions.  This is a silly example, and in practice, this limit arises more due to the presence of outliers.  Typically, we select the bin width after selecting $n_{\\rm bins}$ to span the min and max of the observations; as a result, outliers will coarsen the bins.  In this example, classes A and B from above are compared before (left) and after (right) some outliers are added to A.  The divergences are, again symmetric, but are quite high (above the 0.7 threshold chosen earlier) for the case without the outlier; this is expected since A and B were purposefully prepared to be different.  However, when the outliers are added to A, the overlap between A and B becomes amplified because of bin coarsening, dramatically reducing this divergence which might make you miss the fact that Feature 1 is, in fact, a good feature to use.\n",

This depends on the amount of data you have; more samples means you can tolerate smaller bins, but again, this is subjective and difficult to detemine in advance.  In the example below, we compute the OvA JSD calculations using $n_{\\rm bins}=500$ (left) vs. $n_{\\rm bins}=25$ for the B and C distributions above (designed to be overlapping).

In practice, it is very difficult to assess what an appropriate bin width is then.  The easier approach in practice is to choose $n_{\\rm bins}$; the bin width will be set by the bounds of the distributions and it is much easier to use existing techniques to remove potential outliers which would skew the results.  Even if the outliers are removed, choosing a bad bin width could still cause the JSD to jump toward unity.  Simply choosing a reasonable $n_{\\rm bins} \\sim 25$ is usually easier.  One way to remove outliers is to remove all points outside the IQR and use only this subset for the JSD-based comparisons.  Other approaches could also be devised.\n",
