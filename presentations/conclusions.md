# Conclusions

<style scoped>section{font-size:30px;}</style>

Thank you for your attention and participation! We hope this course provided
you with new information and tools on chemometric modeling. Feel free to go
back and review the material at anytime. Hopefully you have some:

1. Appreciation for the power of :snake: [Python](https://www.python.org/) and its scientific ecosystem,
2. Intuition for different types of models and preprocessing methodologies,
3. Understanding of why [scikit-learn's estimator API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html) makes modeling easy,
4. Awareness of different model explanation tools.
5. Familiarity with [PyChemAuth](https://pychemauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and how this can help standardize and simplify
workflows without the need to install a computing environment.
